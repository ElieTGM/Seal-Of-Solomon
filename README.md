Seal Of Solomon recreated in minecraft for a plugin contest entry.

## What is the Seal Of Solomon?
The Seal Of Solomon (more information on it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_of_Solomon) is a deciphered ring graved by God and was given to the king directly from heaven. It can also be related to a pentagram, or better known as the Devil's Pentagram since it gave the powers to command devils. 

### How the heck are you going to recreate this in Minecraft?
You can check the development by checking the git updates.
